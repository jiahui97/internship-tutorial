In this tutorial, our aim is to include:
1. HapiJS as the base framework of the project
2. Using Postgresql as the database of the project
3. Use Joi to validate the parameters
4. Use JWT as Authentication method

6. Create a session_id that is stored in the JWT
7. Implement roles for different paths
8. Implement Hapi Swagger for the APIs
9. Use Redis to handle the session instead of calling postgresql constantly
10. Added ESlint and Prettier to ensure code structure standard
11. Introduce Travis to compile and run lint
